In order to use the BLE Shield library, also get latest release of Nordic nRF8001 SDK for Arduino from:
https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/ble-sdk-arduino/releases

Put both Nordic's BLE and RBL_BLEShield folders to Arduino libraries folder (e.g. Documents/Arduino/libraries) and load the examples from RBL_BLEShield (Nordic also provides many examples).
